## What is this?
Clean My Prompt is a developer-focused utility designed to stop data leaks. It identifies sensitive patterns (emails, IPs, secrets) in your text and replaces them with dynamic placeholders like `{{EMAIL_1}}`. 

### Key Features:
* **Zero-Server Architecture:** Your data never leaves your browser RAM. 
* **Reverse Sanitization:** Restore original values into AI responses locally.
* **Smart Detection:** Built-in regex for PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
* **Transparent Code:** Publicly hosted right here on GitHub for security audits.

## How it works
1. **Paste** your raw logs or code.
2. **Clean** the prompt with one click.
3. **Copy** to ChatGPT/Claude safely.
4. **Restore** the AI's answer back to your original data.
